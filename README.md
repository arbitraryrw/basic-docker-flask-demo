# Basic Docker Flask Demo
Nikola Cucakovic, November 2019

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to showcase a basic example of using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) together. This is purely for educational purposes as I find the best way to learn is by practically doing. I plan to enhance this in the future by integrating a container management tool such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

## Usage

```

[docker cp](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)
